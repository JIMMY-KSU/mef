<p>The meta-logical layer is populated with constructs
like common cause groups, delete terms, recovery rules,
and exchange events that are used to give flavors to fault trees.
This chapter reviews all these constructs.</p>

<h2>6.1 Common Cause Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#common-cause-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="description">
<h3>6.1.1 Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>From a theoretical view point,
one of the basic assumptions of the fault tree technique
is that occurrences of basic events are independent from a statistical viewpoint.
However, most of the PSA models include, to a large extent, so-called common cause groups.
Common cause groups are groups of basic events
whose failure are not independent from a statistical view point.
They may occur either independently or dependently due to a common cause failure.
So far, existing tools embed three models for common cause failures (CCF):
the beta-factor model, the Multiple Greek letters (MGL) model, and the alpha-factor model.
Alpha-factor and MGL models differ only in the way
the factors for each level (2 components fail, 3 components fail, etc.) are given.
The Model Exchange Format proposes the three mentioned models plus a fourth one,
so-called phi-factor, which is a more direct way to set factors.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Beta-Factor</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>-factor model assumes
that if a common cause occurs,
then all components of the group fail simultaneously.
Components can fail independently.
Multiple independent failures are neglected.
The <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>-factor model assumes, moreover,
that all the components of the group
have the same probability distribution.
It is characterized by this probability distribution
and the conditional probability <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>
that all components fail, given that one component failed.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(BE_1, BE_2, \ldots, BE_n\)</span> be the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> basic events of a common cause group
with a probability distribution <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> and a beta-factor <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>.
Applying the beta-factor model on the fault tree consists in following operations.</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Create new basic events <span class="math">\(BE_{CCF_i}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span>
to represent the independent occurrence of <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(BE_{CCF_i}\)</span> to represent the occurrence of all <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span> together.</li>
<li>Substitute a gate <span class="math">\(G_i = BE_{CCF_i} \lor BE_i\)</span>
for each basic event <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Associate the probability distribution (e.g., <span class="math">\(\beta \times Q\)</span>)
with the event <span class="math">\(BE_{CCF_i}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Multiple Greek Letters</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The Multiple Greek Letters (MGL) model generalizes the beta-factor model.
It considers the cases
where sub-groups of <span class="math">\(1, 2, \ldots, n-1\)</span> components of the group fail together.
This model is characterized by the probability distribution of failure of the components,
and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> factors <span class="math">\(\rho_2, \ldots, \rho_n\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\rho_k\)</span> denotes the conditional probability
that <span class="math">\(k\)</span> components of the group fail given that <span class="math">\(k-1\)</span> failed.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(BE_1, BE_2, \ldots, BE_n\)</span> be the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> basic events of a common cause group
with a probability distribution <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> and factors <span class="math">\(\rho_2, \ldots, \rho_n\)</span>.
Applying the MGL model on the fault tree consists in following operations.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a basic event for each combination of basic events of the group
(there are <span class="math">\(2^n-1\)</span> such combinations).</li>
<li>Transform each basic event <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span> into an OR-gate <span class="math">\(G_i\)</span>
over all newly created event basic events
that represent a group that contains <span class="math">\(BE_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>Associate the following probability distribution
with each newly created basic event representing a group of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> components
(with <span class="math">\(\rho_{n+1} = 0\)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="math">
\[Q_k = \frac{1}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}} \times \left(\prod_{i=2}^{k}\rho_i \right) \times
    (1 - \rho_{k+1}) \times Q\]</div>
<p>For instance, for a group of 4 basic events: A, B, C, and D,
the basic event A is transformed into a gate
<span class="math">\(G_A = A \lor AB \lor AC \lor AD \lor ABC \lor ABD \lor ACD \lor ABDC\)</span>,
and the <span class="math">\(Q_k\)</span>&#8216;s are as follows.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}Q_1&amp; = (1 - \rho_2) \times Q\\
Q_2&amp; = \tfrac{1}{3} \times \rho_2 \times (1 - \rho_3) \times Q\\
Q_3&amp; = \tfrac{1}{3} \times \rho_2 \times \rho_3  \times (1 - \rho_4) \times Q\\
Q_4&amp; = \rho_2 \times \rho_3 \times \rho_4 \times Q\end{split}\]</div>
<p class="last">Note that if <span class="math">\(\rho_k = 0\)</span>,
then <span class="math">\(Q_k, Q_{k+1}, \ldots\)</span> are null as well.
In such a case it is not necessary to create the groups with k elements or more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alpha-Factor</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The alpha-factor model is the same as the MGL model
except in the way the factors are given.
Here <span class="math">\(n\)</span> factors <span class="math">\(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n\)</span> are given.
<span class="math">\(\alpha_k\)</span> represents the fraction of the total failure probability
due to common cause failures that impact exactly <span class="math">\(k\)</span> components.
The distribution associated with a group of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is as follows:</p>
<div class="last math">

<h3>6.2.1 Description<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Delete Terms</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Delete Terms are groups of pairwise exclusive basic events,
used to model impossible configurations.
A typical example is the case where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The basic event a can only occur when the equipment A is in maintenance.</li>
<li>The basic event b can only occur when the equipment B is in maintenance.</li>
<li>Equipment A and B are redundant and cannot be simultaneously in maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most of the tools, delete terms are considered as a post-processing mechanism:
minimal cut sets containing two basic events of a delete terms are discarded.
In order to speed-up calculations,
some tools use basic events to discard minimal cut sets on the fly, during their generation.</p>
<p>Delete Terms can be handled in several ways.
Let <span class="math">\(G = \{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\)</span> be a Delete Term (group).</p>
<ul class="last">
<li><p class="first">A first way to handle <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, is to use it to post-process minimal cut sets,
or to discard them on the fly during their generation.
If a minimal cut set contains at least two of the elements of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>,
it is discarded.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A global constraint <span class="math">\(C_G = \lnot \binom{3}{2}(e_1, e_2, e_3)\)</span> is introduced,
and each top event (or event tree sequences) &#8220;top&#8221; is rewritten as <span class="math">\(top \land C_G\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As for Common Causes Groups, the <span class="math">\(e_i\)</span>&#8216;s are locally rewritten in as gates:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(e_1\)</span> is rewritten as
a gate <span class="math">\(ge_1 = e_1 \land \lnot e_2 \land \lnot e_3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(e_2\)</span> is rewritten as
a gate <span class="math">\(ge_2 = e_2 \land \lnot e_1 \land \lnot e_3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(e_3\)</span> is rewritten as
a gate <span class="math">\(ge_3 = e_3 \land \lnot e_1 \land \lnot e_2\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Recovery Rules</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Recovery Rules are an extension of Delete Terms.
A Recovery Rule is a couple <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is a set of basic events, and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is a (fake) basic event.
It is used to post-process minimal cut sets:
if a minimal cut set <span class="math">\(C\)</span> contains <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is added to <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.
Recovery Rules are used to model actions taken in some specific configurations
to mitigate the risk (hence their name).</p>
<p>Here several remarks can be made.</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>It is possible to mimic Delete Terms by means of recovery rules.
To do so, it suffices to assign the basic event e to the value &#8220;false&#8221; or the probability 0.0.</li>
<li>As for Delete Terms,
it is possible to give purely logical interpretation to Recovery Rules.
The idea is to add a global constraint <span class="math">\(H \Rightarrow e\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math">\(\lnot H \lor e\)</span>,
for each Recovery Rule <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Another definition of Recovery Rules as a post-processing
is that the event <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is substituted for subset <span class="math">\(H\)</span> in the minimal cut set.
This definition, however, has the major drawback
by being impossible to interpret with a Boolean logic.
No Boolean formula can withdraw events from a configuration.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Exchange Events</dt>
<dd>Exchange Events are very similar to Recovery Rules.
An Exchange Event (Rule) is a triple <span class="math">\((H, e, e')\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is a set of basic events,
and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e'\)</span> are two basic events.
Considered as a post-processing of minimal cut sets,
such a rule is interpreted as follows.
If the minimal cut set contains both the set <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and the basic event <span class="math">\(e\)</span>,
then the basic event <span class="math">\(e'\)</span> is substituted for <span class="math">\(e\)</span> in the cut set.
For the same reason as above,
Exchange Events cannot be interpreted with a Boolean logic.</dd>

<h3>6.2.2 All Extra-Logical Constructs in One: the Notion of Substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#all-extra-logical-constructs-in-one-the-notion-of-substitution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Constructs that cannot be interpreted with a Boolean logic
should be avoided for at least two reasons.
First, models containing such constructs are not declarative.
Second, and more importantly,
they tighten assessment tools to one specific type of algorithms.
The second interpretation of Recovery Rules and Exchange Events
tighten the models to be assessed by means of the minimal cut sets approach.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Recovery Rules and Exchange Events are useful and broadly used in practice.
Fortunately, Exchange Events (considered as a post processing mechanism)
can be avoided in many cases by using the instructions
that give flavors to fault trees while walking along event tree sequences:
in a given sequence, one may decide to substitute the event <span class="math">\(e'\)</span> for the event <span class="math">\(e\)</span>
(or the parameter <span class="math">\(p'\)</span> for the parameter <span class="math">\(p\)</span>) in the Fault Trees collected so far.
This mechanism is perfectly acceptable
because it applies while creating the Boolean formula to be assessed.</p>
<p>It is not yet possible to decide
whether Recovery Rules (under the second interpretation) and Exchange Events
can be replaced by purely declarative constructs or by instructions of event trees.
This has to be checked on real-life models.
To represent Delete Term, Recovery Rules and Exchange Events,
the Model Exchange Format introduces a unique construct: the notion of substitution.</p>
<p>A substitution is a triple <span class="math">\((H, S, t)\)</span> where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(H\)</span>, the hypothesis, is a (simple) Boolean formula built over basic events.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(S\)</span>, the source, is also a possibly empty set of basic events.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the target, is either a basic event or a constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be a minimal cut set, i.e., a set of basic events.
The substitution <span class="math">\((H, S, t)\)</span> is applicable on <span class="math">\(C\)</span>
if <span class="math">\(C\)</span> satisfies <span class="math">\(H\)</span> (i.e., if <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is true when <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is realized).
The application of <span class="math">\((H, S, t)\)</span> on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> consists
in removing from <span class="math">\(C\)</span> all the basic events of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>
and in adding to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> the target <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that if t is the constant &#8220;true&#8221;,
adding t to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is equivalent to adding nothing.
If <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is the constant &#8220;false&#8221;,
adding <span class="math">\(t\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is equivalent to discard <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>This notion of substitution generalizes
the notions of Delete Terms, Recovery Rules, and Exchange Events:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Let <span class="math">\(D = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}\)</span>
be a group of pairwise exclusive events (a Delete Term).
Then <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is represented as the substitution
<span class="math">\((\binom{n}{2}(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n), \varnothing, \text{false})\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span> be a Recovery Rule, under the first interpretation,
where <span class="math">\(H = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}\)</span>.
Then, <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span> is represented by the substitution
<span class="math">\((e_1 \land e_2 \land \ldots \land e_n, \varnothing, e)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span> be a Recovery Rule, under the second interpretation,
where <span class="math">\(H = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}\)</span>.
Then <span class="math">\((H, e)\)</span> is represented by the substitution
<span class="math">\((e_1 \land e_2 \land \ldots \land e_n, H, e)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Finally, let <span class="math">\((H, e, e')\)</span> be an Exchange Event Rule,
where <span class="math">\(H = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}\)</span>.
Then <span class="math">\((H, e, e')\)</span> is represented by the substitution
<span class="math">\((e_1 \land e_2 \land \ldots \land e_n \land e, {e}, e')\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a substitution <span class="math">\((H, \varnothing, t)\)</span>
can always be interpreted as the global constraint <span class="math">\(H \Rightarrow t\)</span>.</p>
