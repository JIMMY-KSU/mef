<div class="section" id="why-do-we-need-a-model-exchange-format">
<h2>2.1 Why Do We Need a Model Exchange Format?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-a-model-exchange-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over the years, research efforts have been made in the direction of
&#8220;next generation&#8221; PSA software and &#8220;declarative modeling&#8221;,
which try to present a more informative view of the actual systems, components, and interactions
which the model represents.
The concern of these studies has been to end the use of approximations:
numerical approximations for which we do not know the error factors,
and modeling approximations which leave out perhaps critical elements
of the actual system under study.
From all these investigations,
some issues related to large nuclear PSA models have been raised,
which need to be addressed
before putting new calculation engines or next generation user interfaces into place.
To address these issues enumerated below,
a &#8220;Model Exchange Format&#8221;, a representation which is independent of all PSA software,
must be in place.
In this perspective, software would retain their own internal representation for a model;
moreover, each software would also be able to share models and industry data
by means of the Model Exchange Format.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Quality assurance of calculations</dt>
<dd>At the moment, a model built with one software,
cannot be simply quantified with another software, and visa versa;
there are too many software-dependent features
used by modelers to make inter-calculation comparisons a one-step process.
The Model Exchange Format will allow models to be quantified by several calculation engines,
resulting in stronger quality assurance.</dd>
<dt>Over reliance on numerical approximations and truncation</dt>
<dd>While this cannot be solved directly by the Model Exchange Format,
as new calculation engines are completed,
the Model Exchange Format will allow new engines
to be snapped into new (or existing) user interfaces
without changing the model or user interface software.</dd>
<dt>Portability of the models between different software</dt>
<dd>At the moment, models are essentially non-portable between calculation engines,
as pointed out above.
The Model Exchange Format allows complete, whole models
to be shared right now between software;
the bonus will be on each software to correctly interpret the model representation.</dd>
<dt>Clarity of the models</dt>
<dd>For one who examined a number of large nuclear PRA models, it is obvious
that just looking at the basic events, gates, and fault trees/event trees
is of little help in understanding the &#8220;where&#8221;, &#8220;why&#8221;, and &#8220;how&#8221; of model elements:
common cause failures, initiating events, sequence information, alignment information,
systems and trains, flags, logic of recovery rules, or the dreaded &#8220;delete terms&#8221;.
The Model Exchange Format employs what is becoming known as structured modeling.
Structured Modeling takes its name from the structured programming movement in the 1970s.
Before that time, variables, arrays, and other data structures,
were used with no definitions or explanations.
Structured programming techniques forced programmers
to &#8220;declare variables&#8221; at the beginning of a program by name
and also by the type of variable it was:
an integer, a real number, and so on.
In this way the meaning of the program became clearer,
and calculation speeds were increased.
Structured Modeling, as applied to PRA models and software,
has the same goal of making the meaning of the model
more clear, more transparent, and to improve the speed and accuracy of the calculation.
The user interface to create such a model is not of concern here.
The concern is to discover the distinct model elements
which are needed to quantify and clarify large PRA models.</dd>
<dt>Completeness of the models</dt>
<dd>Without clarity, there can be no knowledge of the completeness of the model,
since their very size and complexity strains the brain.
The Model Exchange Format will create more survey-able models.</dd>
<dt>Difficulty of different software working with the same PSA model</dt>
<dd>As more risk applications are being requested
(seismic, fire, balance of plant assessments, risk monitors, release calculations),
difficulties are arising
because each risk application and major PSA software have different internal data formats.
The Model Exchange Format will enable easy sharing of model data between applications,
and specialized software would be available for all models.</dd>
<dt>Lack of data and software backward and forward compatibility</dt>
<dd>Again, as more diverse software need to interact,
such as safety monitors, calculation engines, and fault tree editors,
the need to have data and programs separate becomes of high importance.
The Model Exchange Format solves this problem by allowing programs to change
without the need for the data format to change
and for other programs to change their operations.</dd>
<dt>No universal format for industry data</dt>
<dd>The Model Exchange Format will be a perfect way to publish industry data,
such as common cause, failure rates, incidents, and initiating event frequencies.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements-for-the-model-exchange-format">
<h2>2.2 Requirements for the Model Exchange Format<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-for-the-model-exchange-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To be acceptable and widely accepted,
the Model Exchange Format for PSA must fulfill a number of requirements.
The following list is an attempt to summarize these requirements.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Soundness</dt>
<dd>The Model Exchange Format must be unambiguous.
The semantics of each construct must be clearly given in such way
that no two correct implementations of the Model Exchange Format
can differ in their interpretation of models
(however, they may differ at least to a certain extent, in the results
they provide if they use different calculation methods).</dd>
<dt>Completeness</dt>
<dd>The Model Exchange Format should cover as much as possible;
not only all aspects of PSA models,
but also references to external documentations and format of the results.
These issues have to be covered by the Model Exchange Format
in order to make models actually portable
and to be able to cross check calculations.</dd>
<dt>Clarity</dt>
<dd>The Model Exchange Format should be self-documenting to a large extent.
The constructs of the Model Exchange Format should reflect
what the designer of the model has in mind.
Low level constructs would help in making the format universal
(any model can eventually be represented by means of a FORTRAN or C program,
not to speak of a Turing machine or a Church lambda term),
but constructs which are at too low a level would be of little help,
and even counter-productive, for model review.</dd>
<dt>Generality</dt>
<dd>It should be possible to cast all the existing models
into the Model Exchange Format without rewriting them from scratch.
The translation of existing models should be automated,
at least to a large extent.
Moreover, any existing tool should be able to use the Model Exchange Format
as its representation language.
Indeed, most of the tools implement only a subpart of the Model Exchange Format,
but the Model Exchange Format should be a superset of the underlying formalisms
of all existing tools.</dd>
<dt>Extensibility</dt>
<dd>The Model Exchange Format should not restrict developers
if they wish to introduce interesting new features in their tools.
This means that it should be easy to introduce new constructs into the Model Exchange Format,
even if these constructs are not recognized by all tools.
On the other hand, these new constructs should be clearly identified;
their semantics should be clear and public
in such way that any other developer can embed the feature in his own tool.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choice-of-xml">
<h2>2.3 Choice of XML<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-of-xml" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create the Model Exchange Format,
we must make formal definitions for representing existing PRA models
and define a syntax to write them.
The Model Exchange Format is defined as an XML document type.
XML is widely used on the Internet as a common way for programs to share data.
It is well structured and makes it possible to give explicit name to each construct.
XML, therefore, is well suited for structured modeling.
By giving the elements of a model a formal designation
(&#8220;this is an initiating event&#8221;, &#8220;this is a basic event&#8221;, and so on),
quantification results and understanding of the model can be improved.</p>
<p>XML presents another major advantage for tool developers:
many development teams have more or less already designed its own XML parser
and many such parsers are anyway freely available on the Internet.
Therefore, the choice of an XML based syntax discharges programmers of PSA tools
of the tedious task to design parsers and to perform syntactic checks.
Moreover, due to their tree-like structure,
it is easy to ignore parts of an XML description
that are not relevant for a particular purpose.
Therefore, tools which do not implement the whole Model Exchange Format
can easily pick up what they are able to deal with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-four-plus-one-layer-architecture">
<h2>2.4 A Four-Plus-One Layer Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#a-four-plus-one-layer-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Model Exchange Format relies on a four-plus-one layer architecture,
as pictured in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-mef-arch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2.1</span></a>.
Each layer corresponds to a specific class of objects/mathematical constructs.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="fig-mef-arch">
<img alt="../_images/architecture.svg" src="../_images/architecture.svg" /><p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2.1 </span><span class="caption-text">Architecture of the Model Exchange Format</span></p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first, or stochastic, layer is populated with all stochastic aspects of models:
probability distributions for the failure rates of basic events,
parameters of these distributions and distributions of these parameters, flags, etc.</li>
<li>The second, or fault tree layer, is populated with logical components of fault trees
(gates, basic events, house events).
This layer is the core of PSA models.
The two first layers can be used in isolation.
Some existing tools implement them only.</li>
<li>The third, or meta-logical, layer is populated with constructs
like common cause groups, delete terms, and recovery rules
that are used to give flavors to fault trees.</li>
<li>The fourth, or event tree, layer is populated with event trees,
initiating events, and consequences.
The Model Exchange Format sees event trees as (graphical) programs.
The execution of such a program produces a set of sequences,
i.e., a set (a disjunction) of Boolean formulae.
Probability distributions are also collected while walking the event tree.</li>
<li>The fifth, or report layer, is populated with constructs to store results of calculations.
This includes constructs to describe calculations
(version of the model, used engine, used cutoffs,
targeted group of consequences, calculated quantities, etc.)
as well as minimal cut sets and other results.</li>
</ul>
<p>This five-layer architecture helps to understand
what the different elements of a model are
and what their respective roles are.
In a word, it is the backbone of the Model Exchange Format.
However, it should be clear
that any model will contain elements of the first fourth levels
and that these elements may not be arranged by levels.
For instance, a fault tree description will probably contain
probability distributions of basic events as well as common cause groups.
Again, the five-layer architecture intends to differentiate elements
according to their meanings and operational behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formalism">
<h2>2.5 Formalism<a class="headerlink" href="#formalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout this document, we shall present a number of syntactic constructions,
such as Boolean formulae, probability distributions, and so on.
These constructions will eventually be represented by means of XML terms.
However, XML is a bit too verbose
to make clear the underlying mathematical nature of objects at hand.
Therefore, we shall use an XML schema language to define constructs.</p>
<p>There are several formal ways to describe an XML grammar.
The most popular approach is to use one of XML schema languages,
such as the XML Document Type Definition (DTD), XML Schema Definition (XSD),
RELAX NG (REgular LAnguage for XML Next Generation), Schematron.
The Model Exchange Format used to use the DTD for its formal schema;
however, mainly due to the DTD&#8217;s lack of maintainability, age,
and limitations (a lack of context awareness),
<a class="reference external" href="http://relaxng.org/compact-20021121.html">RELAX NG Compact</a> (RNC) has been chosen as a modern replacement.
The RNC has a non-XML syntax and leverages regular expression operators
(similar to the DTD and Extended Backus Naur Form)
and is structured in a very concise and human-readable form,
and unlike the DTD, the RNC is feature-rich enough to support the MEF grammar.
Even though the RNC language is very self-descriptive,
please consult with <a class="reference external" href="http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html">RELAX NG Compact Tutorial</a> and the specification
to gain familiarity.
In addition to the schema,
we shall present the grammar of the Model Exchange Format by means of examples.</p>
<p>The RNC schemas describing the Model Exchange Format
can be combined into the main schema for validation purposes.
The MEF XML schemas in various other formats
are provided at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/open-psa/schemas">the MEF schemas repository</a>.
These schemas are auto-generated from the RNC schema in this specification.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the XML descriptions we are giving here
can be extended in any way to fulfill the needs of a particular tool.
In particular, comments and pointers to documentation
should be added here and there to the model.</p>

<h2>2.6 Organization of the document<a class="headerlink" href="#organization-of-the-document" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The remainder of this document is organized into six chapters,

one chapter per layer of the architecture of the Model Exchange Format
and one additional chapter for models as a whole.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="anatomy.html#mef-anatomy"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 3</span></a> gives an overview of main elements of a model

<li><a class="reference internal" href="fault_tree_layer.html#fault-tree-layer"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 4</span></a> presents the fault tree layer.
The fault tree layer is not the lowest one in the hierarchy.

For this reason, we put it in front.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="stochastic_layer.html#stochastic-layer"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 5</span></a> presents the stochastic layer,
i.e., all the mechanisms to associate probability distributions to basic events.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="meta_logical_layer.html#meta-logical-layer"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 6</span></a> presents the meta-logical layer.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="event_tree_layer.html#event-tree-layer"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 7</span></a> presents the event tree layer.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="model_organization.html#model-organization"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 8</span></a> discusses the organization of models.</li>
<li>Finally, <a class="reference internal" href="report_layer.html#report-layer"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 9</span></a> presents the report/results layer,
